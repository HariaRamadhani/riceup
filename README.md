# RiceUp
Rice is a staple food in Indonesia, yet farmers still face various challenges in the cultivation process such as pest attacks, disease outbreaks, and the inability to accurately predict yields resulting in huge losses and inefficient resource management. Traditional farming methods are often unable to address these issues as farmers lack access to technological solutions for early disease detection and yield prediction. Given the high adoption of digital technology in Indonesia, RiceUp integrates machine learning, mobile development, and cloud computing to assist farmers in disease detection and yield prediction using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for image analysis and linear regression for yield prediction based on various environmental and agricultural factors.
